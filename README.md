# My LeetCode Solutions & Lessons Repository


I love LeetCode. Probably because I don't do it for interviews (thankfully not a *cooked* CS major), but for the genuine satisfaction of working through logical challenges and learning algorithms.

That said, I have struggled with consistency and long-term retention. Early on, I would spend a lot of time understanding the algorithm behind a problem before writing any code. But when I revisited the same question a week later, I would often draw a complete blank.

This repository (especially making it Public!) is my attempt to fix that. Alongside my solutions, I aim to document my thought process, lessons learned, and improvements made.

## How I practice LeetCode problems: A detailed breakdown

I don't think there is a single "right way" to practice LeetCode problems, but this is what I have learned (and try to implement)from watching YouTube videos and reading Reddit posts. I have drafted this as a way to not only organize my thoughts but hopefully help anyone trying to find the solution to cracking LeetCode.
