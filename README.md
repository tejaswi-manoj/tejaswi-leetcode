# My LeetCode Solutions & Lessons Repository


I love LeetCode. Probably because I don't do it for interviews (thankfully not a *cooked* CS major), but for the genuine satisfaction of working through logical challenges.

That said, I have struggled with consistency and long-term retention. Early on, I would spend a lot of time understanding the algorithm behind a problem before writing any code. But when I revisited the same question a week later, I would often draw a complete blank.

This repository is my attempt to fix that. Alongside my solutions, I document my thought process, lessons learned, and improvements made.
